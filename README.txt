In this work, we used MATLAB 2018a in order to implement Detection of Altered Handwritten Text in Handwritten Document Images. 
In this work we have explored New Handwritten Document Images dataset, which consist of Ten Different Forgery classes ( Multiple
Forgery operations performed on Handwritten Document Images). The Traditional Features like Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOG),
Local Binary Patterns(LBP) and Statistical Features were extracted and given these features as input to Naive Bayes Classifier 
for final multiclass classification task.  This study is communicated with an Internation Journal, Multimedia Tools and Applications,
Springer.
